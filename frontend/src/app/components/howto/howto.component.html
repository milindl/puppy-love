      <li> Select up to 4 of your interests (only opposite gender supported for now).</li>
      <li> These choices will <strong>NOT</strong> be visible to <strong>anyone</strong> else.</li>
      <li> Lock and submit your choices! Remember, you cannot change your choices after this.</li>
      <li> Check back regularly to receive hearts signifying how many people like you :)</li>
      <li> Open the platform at midnight on 14th of February to know if one or more of your interests likes you back :)</li>
      <li> Remember, if your interest does not like you back, he/she will NEVER know that you like them. </li>
